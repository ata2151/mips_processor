# mips_processor

*This project is aimed to demomnstrate my understanding of digital systems, VHDL skills, modular design.*

A broad overview of the project can be seen below. For a detail, description please check out the full report (in french) here.

Implemented reduced instruction set computer with pipe-lining using VHDL.
•	Added hazard correction capabilities that can flush out parts of the processor and create a gap in the pipeline
•	Created a timing diagram  for every module to ensure correct functionality using ModelSim software and tested it on an FPGA
